# Prometheus supports the following options:

#   -config.file "/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml"
#      Prometheus configuration file name.
#
# == ALERTMANAGER ==
#
#   -alertmanager.notification-queue-capacity 10000
#      The capacity of the queue for pending alert manager notifications.
#
#   -alertmanager.timeout 10s
#      Alert manager HTTP API timeout.
#
#   -alertmanager.url
#      The URL of the alert manager to send notifications to.
#
# == LOG ==
#
#   -log.format
#      If set use a syslog logger or JSON logging. Example:
#      logger:syslog?appname=bob&local=7 or logger:stdout?json=true. Defaults to
#      stderr.
#
#   -log.level "info"
#      Only log messages with the given severity or above. Valid levels:
#      [debug, info, warn, error, fatal].
#
# == QUERY ==
#
#   -query.max-concurrency 20
#      Maximum number of queries executed concurrently.
#
#   -query.staleness-delta 5m0s
#      Staleness delta allowance during expression evaluations.
#
#   -query.timeout 2m0s
#      Maximum time a query may take before being aborted.
#
# == STORAGE ==
#
#   -storage.local.checkpoint-dirty-series-limit 5000
#      If approx. that many time series are in a state that would require
#      a recovery operation after a crash, a checkpoint is triggered, even if
#      the checkpoint interval hasn't passed yet. A recovery operation requires
#      a disk seek. The default limit intends to keep the recovery time below
#      1min even on spinning disks. With SSD, recovery is much faster, so you
#      might want to increase this value in that case to avoid overly frequent
#      checkpoints.
#
#   -storage.local.checkpoint-interval 5m0s
#      The period at which the in-memory metrics and the chunks not yet
#      persisted to series files are checkpointed.
#
#   -storage.local.chunk-encoding-version 1
#      Which chunk encoding version to use for newly created chunks.
#      Currently supported is 0 (delta encoding) and 1 (double-delta encoding).
#
#   -storage.local.dirty false
#      If set, the local storage layer will perform crash recovery even if
#      the last shutdown appears to be clean.
#
#   -storage.local.index-cache-size.fingerprint-to-metric 10485760
#      The size in bytes for the fingerprint to metric index cache.
#
#   -storage.local.index-cache-size.fingerprint-to-timerange 5242880
#      The size in bytes for the metric time range index cache.
#
#   -storage.local.index-cache-size.label-name-to-label-values 10485760
#      The size in bytes for the label name to label values index cache.
#
#   -storage.local.index-cache-size.label-pair-to-fingerprints 20971520
#      The size in bytes for the label pair to fingerprints index cache.
#
#   -storage.local.max-chunks-to-persist 524288
#      How many chunks can be waiting for persistence before sample
#      ingestion will be throttled. Many chunks waiting to be persisted will
#      increase the checkpoint size.
#
#   -storage.local.memory-chunks 1048576
#      How many chunks to keep in memory. While the size of a chunk is
#      1kiB, the total memory usage will be significantly higher than this value
#      * 1kiB. Furthermore, for various reasons, more chunks might have to be
#      kept in memory temporarily. Sample ingestion will be throttled if the
#      configured value is exceeded by more than 10%.
#
#   -storage.local.path "/var/lib/prometheus/metrics"
#      Base path for metrics storage.
#
#   -storage.local.pedantic-checks false
#      If set, a crash recovery will perform checks on each series file.
#      This might take a very long time.
#
#   -storage.local.retention 360h0m0s
#      How long to retain samples in the local storage.
#
#   -storage.local.series-file-shrink-ratio 0.1
#      A series file is only truncated (to delete samples that have
#      exceeded the retention period) if it shrinks by at least the provided
#      ratio. This saves I/O operations while causing only a limited storage
#      space overhead. If 0 or smaller, truncation will be performed even for a
#      single dropped chunk, while 1 or larger will effectively prevent any
#      truncation.
#
#   -storage.local.series-sync-strategy "adaptive"
#      When to sync series files after modification. Possible values:
#      'never', 'always', 'adaptive'. Sync'ing slows down storage performance
#      but reduces the risk of data loss in case of an OS crash. With the
#      'adaptive' strategy, series files are sync'd for as long as the storage
#      is not too much behind on chunk persistence.
#
#   -storage.remote.graphite-address
#      The host:port of the remote Graphite server to send samples to.
#      None, if empty.
#
#   -storage.remote.graphite-prefix
#      The prefix to prepend to all metrics exported to Graphite. None, if
#      empty.
#
#   -storage.remote.graphite-transport "tcp"
#      Transport protocol to use to communicate with Graphite. 'tcp', if
#      empty.
#
#   -storage.remote.influxdb-url
#      The URL of the remote InfluxDB server to send samples to. None, if
#      empty.
#
#   -storage.remote.influxdb.database "prometheus"
#      The name of the database to use for storing samples in InfluxDB.
#
#   -storage.remote.influxdb.retention-policy "default"
#      The InfluxDB retention policy to use.
#
#   -storage.remote.influxdb.username
#      The username to use when sending samples to InfluxDB. The
#      corresponding password must be provided via the INFLUXDB_PW environment
#      variable.
#
#   -storage.remote.opentsdb-url
#      The URL of the remote OpenTSDB server to send samples to. None, if
#      empty.
#
#   -storage.remote.timeout 30s
#      The timeout to use when sending samples to the remote storage.
#
# == WEB ==
#
#   -web.console.libraries "/etc/prometheus/console_libraries"
#      Path to the console library directory.
#
#   -web.console.templates "/etc/prometheus/consoles"
#      Path to the console template directory, available at /consoles.
#
#   -web.enable-remote-shutdown false
#      Enable remote service shutdown.
#
#   -web.external-url
#      The URL under which Prometheus is externally reachable (for
#      example, if Prometheus is served via a reverse proxy). Used for
#      generating relative and absolute links back to Prometheus itself. If the
#      URL has a path portion, it will be used to prefix all HTTP endpoints
#      served by Prometheus. If omitted, relevant URL components will be derived
#      automatically.
#
#   -web.listen-address ":9090"
#      Address to listen on for the web interface, API, and telemetry.
#
#   -web.local-assets "/usr/share/prometheus/web/"
#      Path to static assets/templates directory.
#
#   -web.telemetry-path "/metrics"
#      Path under which to expose metrics.
#
#   -web.user-assets
#      Path to static asset directory, available at /user.
