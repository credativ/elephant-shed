# Files here named *.yml will be used by update-prometheus-sql-exporter-config
# to update the prometheus-sql-exporter config in /var/run/postgresql/.
# Queries with scope 'cluster' are executed once per cluster (via the
# 'postgres' database). Scope 'database' queries are executed in each database.
# Example:

#- name: "application_hits"
#  help: "Web hits in our application"
#  scope: database # or 'cluster'
#  min_version: 9.0
#  max_version: 9.6
#  # alternative: version: 10 # run only on this version (regexp)
#  cluster: main # run only on this cluster (regexp)
#  database: appdb # run only on this database (regexp)
#  labels:
#    - "username"
#  values:
#    - "count"
#  query: |
#          SELECT username, count(*) FROM applog GROUP BY username
